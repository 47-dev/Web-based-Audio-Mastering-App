NO PAID SDK/Plugin/Library/API etc can be used. ONLY Open Source. Users should be able to login/register, create projects, upload Mp3/WAV files, store in the dashboard, share/download after mastering. User can also make their music match to a target/reference music. We can also create a library of Reference music and suggest user best matches by analyzing his uploaded music. You need to create buttons for: Equalizer Compressor Stereo Enhancement Loudness Control I have found some JavaScript Libraries, PHP/Python Libraries too. The List is attached.
